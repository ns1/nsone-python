About
=====

This package provides a python SDK for accessing the NSONE DNS platform
and includes both a simple NSONE REST API wrapper as well as a higher level
interface for managing zones, records, data feeds, and more.
It supports synchronous and asynchronous transports.

Both python 2.7 and 3.3 are supported.

Installation
============

  $ pip install nsone

Dependencies
============

None, but supports different transport backends. Currently supported:

 * `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_ (synchronous, the default if available)
 * urllib (synchronous, the default if requests isn't available)
 * `twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ (asynchronous)

Other transports are easy to add, see `transport <https://github.com/nsone/nsone-python/tree/master/nsone/rest/transport>`_
